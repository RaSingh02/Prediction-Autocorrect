# Prediction-Autocorrect
We were tasked with creating a predictive text system that statistically determines spelling errors and proceeds to correct such errors. We were also tasked with creating a word prediction system that would allow a user to submit a line of text and the program will result in what is determined to be the next word statistically. Data sourced from Peter Norvig, director at Google. We also used Mr. Norvig's spelling correction program as a base for our own implementation.
